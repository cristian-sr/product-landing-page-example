# Product Landing Page - Example

Intermediate HTML project on our list, and it’s now time to push your boundaries!

But enough of the suspense, what are we building?

For this HTML project, we’re going to build a product landing page.

You’ll also be using the popular CSS framework Bootstrap.

Note that I’ve chosen to use the Bootstrap framework because it’s a widely used tool in web development. We’ll also be using the CDN version rather than installing it locally.

After all, why not build your marketable skills while also extending your knowledge?

This project also builds on each of the previous projects in this article by incorporating a variety of HTML elements and layouts that you’ll commonly find on commercial websites.

In our case, this will be a single, comprehensive page that showcases a product, service, or application.

To build this project, you can expect to grips with the following HTML skills:

- Navigation bar: Create a sticky menu that stays at the top when scrolling.
- Call-to-action (CTA): Design buttons to grab attention and encourage clicks.
- Forms: Add a form for users to sign up or contact you for more information.
- Bootstrap Framework: Utilize Bootstrap classes to layout content and achieve a responsive design.
- Media Queries: Write custom media queries to make sure the page looks good on all devices.

Just like before, this HTML project is a definite step up in complexity, but trust me, the end result is worth the effort.

We’re also adding responsive design with this project, which is an essential skill for any aspiring web developer.

When you’re ready, dive into the HTML and CSS source code to get started.

Note also that the CSS stylesheet is very short for this project because we’re using Bootstrap.

I’d recommend getting familiar with the official Bootstrap docs to learn how to experiment with its various offerings.

There are a lot, so don’t feel overwhelmed! But this is a great idea to help you get experimental with the project.

Like I keep saying, you really learn a lot by tinkering with things and making changes, so don’t let this project be any different!
